## 2. User Roles

Minimum required roles:

- Administrator: can manage all records and system settings.
- Standard user: can view and manage only the records assigned to the normal workflow.

## 4. Non-functional Requirements

The application must be easy to run locally. The user interface must be readable on laptop and mobile screen sizes. The code must be organised into logical folders. Secrets must not be committed to GitHub. The database must be initialised from scripts. Docker Compose must start the required services.

## 5. Technical Requirements

Use Git for version control. Use GitHub for the final repository. Use Docker Compose for local execution. Use PostgreSQL or MariaDB unless the teacher approves a different database.
